Hello,

Here is the important things to know:



- The project is implemented in a Google Colab Notebook. 
- I upload the data from Google Drive and save to there. I used the following path for the data folder:

	'/content/drive/MyDrive/Geometric_methods_PROJECT/schic/processed/..'

	I think you can access the same data folder in your local using this path:

	'/schic/processed/..'

- The - The zip file contains the Colab notebook and SCC_results.txt. 
	SCC_results.txt contains the SCC scores calculated between the Hi-C contact maps. 
- Each section is explained in a detailed way in the Notebook. Please let me know if you have any questions: ufuk-cem.birbiri@etu.univ-cotedazur.fr

 Thank you and have fun!
